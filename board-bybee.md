As a usage‑based grammarian, I find the central connection you propose compelling, but the frequency argument as currently written is more asserted than demonstrated. The paper gives plausible counts (“30–50 uses per day”), yet those are speculative and not anchored in data, and the mechanism depends on **construction‑specific frequency**, not just raw frequency of the word. To make the causal claim hold, you need evidence that *Mom/Dad* are overwhelmingly frequent **in vocative and name‑slot constructions**, and that these distributions are distinctive relative to other high‑frequency address terms. As it stands, the frequency claim reads as a reasonable hypothesis rather than a supported explanation.

The usage‑based framing is present but not yet rigorous in Bybee’s sense. A usage‑based account needs explicit commitments about the network of constructions and how tokens accumulate into entrenched units; right now the analysis leans heavily on CGEL’s categorical labels (proper name vs common noun), which are useful descriptively but can mask gradient, usage‑conditioned behavior. I would explicitly separate **token frequency** (driving autonomy/entrenchment) from **type frequency** (driving productivity) and show how each predicts the observed patterns: e.g., *Mom* is highly entrenched and resists modification (low productivity), whereas *my mom* remains productive and compositionally interpretable. You should also tighten the definition of “entrenchment” (processing ease, conventionalization, resistance to analysis) and show which diagnostics you will actually use.

To strengthen the entrenchment claims, I’d add quantitative corpus evidence. At minimum: counts of bare kin terms vs determiner forms in spoken corpora (family discourse if possible; CHILDES is a natural starting point), and a breakdown by function (vocative, subject, object, apposition). Include comparison sets—*teacher*, *boss*, *sir/ma’am*, *honey*—to show that high vocative frequency alone does not automatically yield bare singular subjects with definite readings. You can also add diagnostics consistent with entrenchment: reduced prosodic prominence in referential *Mom*, limited modification (*?dear Mom* vs *my dear mom*), fixed collocations (*Mom said*, *Dad told me*), and speaker judgments about retrieval (“I said *Mom* without thinking”). These provide usage‑based evidence beyond simple acceptability.

Finally, the causal claim needs disconfirmation of alternatives. The semantics/uniqueness account is addressed, but you should test it more directly with cases like only‑child cousins or unique occupational roles, and with dialects/families where the taboo is weaker. A brief diachronic or sociolinguistic slice—e.g., whether *Mother/Father* as bare subjects increase/decrease over time, or whether communities that use first‑name address show less bare *Mom*—would sharply strengthen the argument. In short: the framing is promising, but to make it convincing as a usage‑based account you need distributional evidence, clear constructional mapping, and a sharper empirical separation between taboo‑driven frequency and other pragmatic/semantic forces.
