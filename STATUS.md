## Key Changes (2025-12-29)

1. **CHILDES corpus evidence** - Frequency table showing parent terms 16-43% vocative, extended kin 4-7%
2. **Malagasy prediction refined** - *ry*/bare in vocative vs. *i/ra* in argument position (Paul 2018, Potsdam 2010)
3. **Literature strengthened** - Sloat 1969, Longobardi 1994, Hill 2022, Kripke 1980
4. **Cross-cultural naming taboos** - Hawaiian kapu, Zulu hlonipha, Apache ghost-names
5. **Repository public** - [github.com/BrettRey/English_kinship_terms](https://github.com/BrettRey/English_kinship_terms)

### 2026-02-10 Session Notes (session 2)
- Cut Longobardi/DP paragraph from §6.4 entirely (paper doesn't need to engage with DP framework)
- Cut two redundant recap paragraphs opening the conclusion; now opens with "Three contributions stand out"
- Tightened Parent Trap return to avoid near-verbatim echoes of intro; "restoration of a word" → "restoration of a license"
- Fixed Oxford spelling: realisation → realization (2 instances)
- Updated acknowledgements: Claude Opus 4.5 → 4.6
- Researched Chomsky DP-rejection: best candidate is Chomsky (2021) *Gengo Kenkyu* 160: 1–41; Pullum & Miller (2022) "NPs versus DPs: why Chomsky was right" on lingbuzz — source unverified, not cited
- Renamed PDF for lingbuzz upload

### 2026-02-10 Session Notes (session 1)
- Contracted 18 uncontracted forms (house style: contractions preferred)
- Cut redundancy: 4.7% adjacency paragraph, sediment analogy cluster, engine/counterfactual paragraph, hlonipha preview, weaker-taboo restatement
- Rewrote §6.2 (semantics objection): "precondition" → candidacy framing (Partee-inspired); dropped "consistency" argument
- Cut Korean/Japanese from §5.4 (no proper-noun diagnostic in article-less languages)
- Fixed plural-author references in single-author paper (our → present purposes, I, the frequency mechanism)
- Added relational persistence to Teacher/Waiter contrast
- Distanced from Longobardi/DP; rewrote diachronic prediction as honestly untestable
- Used \mentionhead for sir/ma'am heading; tempered frequency claim

### 2026-02-09 Session Notes
- Intro restructured: proper-name/proper-noun distinction moved earlier into CGEL subsection
- Deitality subsection compressed from 3 paragraphs to 1
- Caregiver self-reference added as secondary frequency factor with Duranti 2011 citation
- Bybee paraphrase rewritten for clarity
- Abstract refined ("correlates with" replacing "predicts")
- Vocative footnote streamlined with forward reference to §3
- *Parent Trap* footnoted as "Disney, 1998"
- Insertion points: Dziwirek2019, Downing1996, BensonAnglin1987 all integrated; Surono2018 superseded by cross-cultural opening

### 2026-02-06 Session Notes
- Sharpened proper-name / proper-noun distinction throughout: bare *Mom* IS a proper name (naming function, binary); the gradient across kinship terms is in proper-noun entrenchment (lexical category)
- New paragraph in CGEL framework subsection making the distinction explicit
- New sentence before gradient examples locating the gradient in proper-noun entrenchment
- ~25 terminology fixes: "proper-name syntax/status/properties" → "proper-noun" (except Malagasy "proper-name determiners")
- Section 3 heading now "Kinship terms with proper-noun status"
- HPC perspective motivated the edits but HPC vocabulary stays out of the paper

## Remaining Limitations

- Diachronic evidence thin (when did bare *Mom* become licensed?)
- Scandinavian weak-taboo prediction anecdotal
- Malagasy prediction awaits fieldwork
