### 2026-02-09 Session Notes
- Intro restructured: proper-name/proper-noun distinction moved earlier into CGEL subsection
- Deitality subsection compressed from 3 paragraphs to 1
- Caregiver self-reference added as secondary frequency factor with Duranti 2011 citation
- Bybee paraphrase rewritten for clarity
- Abstract refined ("correlates with" replacing "predicts")
- Vocative footnote streamlined with forward reference to §3
- *Parent Trap* footnoted as "Disney, 1998"
- Insertion points: Dziwirek2019, Downing1996, BensonAnglin1987 all integrated; Surono2018 superseded by cross-cultural opening

### 2026-02-06 Session Notes
- Sharpened proper-name / proper-noun distinction throughout: bare *Mom* IS a proper name (naming function, binary); the gradient across kinship terms is in proper-noun entrenchment (lexical category)
- New paragraph in CGEL framework subsection making the distinction explicit
- New sentence before gradient examples locating the gradient in proper-noun entrenchment
- ~25 terminology fixes: "proper-name syntax/status/properties" → "proper-noun" (except Malagasy "proper-name determiners")
- Section 3 heading now "Kinship terms with proper-noun status"
- HPC perspective motivated the edits but HPC vocabulary stays out of the paper

## Remaining Limitations

- Diachronic evidence thin (when did bare *Mom* become licensed?)
- Scandinavian weak-taboo prediction anecdotal
- Malagasy prediction awaits fieldwork
