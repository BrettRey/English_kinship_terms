From a politeness‑theoretic perspective, the framing is promising but still a bit thin. You invoke Brown & Levinson to motivate the taboo, yet you treat “face” mostly as a backdrop rather than an analytic object. I’d encourage you to make the face model do more work: specify which face claims are at stake in the parent‑child asymmetry and how the address system sustains them over time. As written, the politeness section reads like a justification for why the taboo exists, but it doesn’t fully show how facework in interaction actively channels forms into the vocative slot that later grammaticalize.

On adequacy of the face‑threat analysis: you currently cast first‑name address as a generalized FTA, but you don’t parse whose face is threatened or which component (positive vs. negative) is implicated. Calling a parent by first name could threaten the parent’s positive face (status/recognition) and also challenge the parent’s role‑based negative face (entitlements to deference), while simultaneously endangering the child’s own face (risk of sanction, being seen as disrespectful). These are distinct and, crucially, they are negotiated in interaction. If you spell out these face claims and show how they are co‑managed—rather than simply asserted—you’ll strengthen the causal story.

The sociopragmatic dimension would benefit from more explicit attention to variation. “Mainstream Anglophone norms” is a start, but it needs anchoring: class, region, ethnicity, family ideology, and life‑course stage all condition what counts as marked. There are communities where first‑name address is a solidarity move rather than a face threat, and households where “Mom”/“Dad” co‑exist with first names or nicknames without sanctions. If you integrate this variability (even briefly), you can show that the taboo is not categorical but a gradient norm—precisely the kind of gradient that your grammaticalization claim predicts.

Methodologically, you could strengthen the argument by bringing in evidence of facework in action: metapragmatic comments (“Don’t call me Sarah”), repair sequences, teasing, or explicit sanctions around address choices. That kind of interactional evidence would concretize the “taboo” as an enacted social practice, not just a sociological generalization. It would also let you show how address forms can be face‑enhancing as well as face‑threatening (e.g., the affective warmth of “Mom” as positive‑politeness work), which helps explain why these terms are so entrenched.

Finally, consider widening the politeness lens beyond a single model. Brown & Levinson is a useful starting point, but the literature on relational work and rapport management would let you treat face as relational and co‑constructed, not simply individual. That framing fits your broader usage‑based argument: the taboo is sustained through ongoing relational negotiations, and those negotiations are exactly what generate the high‑frequency, name‑position usage you see as the engine of grammaticalization.
