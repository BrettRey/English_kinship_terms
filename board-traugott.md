Speaking as Elizabeth Traugott, I find the proposed pathway intriguing and potentially viable, but not yet convincing as a grammaticalization claim. You currently lean heavily on frequency and slot occupancy, which is compatible with usage-based change but not sufficient to establish grammaticalization or constructionalization. I would urge you to make explicit whether you are arguing for grammaticalization proper, or for constructionalization of a new form–function pairing (“bare kin term = proper-name status”), and then align your criteria with that choice (e.g., changes in compositionality, schematicity, and paradigmatic relations).

On the stages, the characterization needs tightening. Stage 1 as a possessive NP (“my mom”) is not obviously the diachronic source of the bare vocative; vocatives are bare by default and may be a more plausible source construction. The crucial step is the shift from vocative to argumental NP use, and that needs clearer “bridging” and “switch” contexts—e.g., quoted speech, reported address, or narrative frames where an addressee-directed form is reinterpreted as a referential argument. Right now the pathway is sketched rather than demonstrated, and the reanalysis point (what exactly gets reanalyzed, and in what environments) remains under-specified.

What is most missing is a historical account that could substantiate the causal story. You need diachronic evidence for (i) when bare argumental uses of kinship terms arise, (ii) when the address taboo becomes robust in English-speaking communities, and (iii) how the shift from mother/father to mom/dad interacts with address practice. Without at least a modest corpus timeline (letters, diaries, fiction, CHILDES/COHA-style sources), the directionality and timing of the change are assumed rather than shown. Variation by class, region, and register could provide crucial evidence for or against the taboo-driven mechanism.

A stronger Traugottian account would also foreground invited inferencing and (inter)subjectification: the address use is intensely intersubjective, and the shift to referential proper-name status could be framed as the conventionalization of addressee-oriented inferences in third-person contexts. This would let you invoke well-known grammaticalization diagnostics—layering (bare vs. determiner uses), persistence (relational semantics in determined NPs), and divergence—rather than relying primarily on frequency. It would also help you distinguish grammaticalization from lexicalization or onomastic reanalysis, which are currently plausible alternative characterizations.

Finally, your cross-linguistic predictions need tighter operationalization. In some systems with strong taboos, kin terms grammaticalize toward pronominal or honorific systems rather than proper-name status; this would complicate the “taboo → proper-name syntax” pathway. If you spell out language-specific diagnostics (not just article omission), you can preserve the typological reach while making the hypothesis falsifiable. That would considerably strengthen the paper’s explanatory ambition without sacrificing the core insight.
