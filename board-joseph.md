From a history‑of‑linguistics angle, this paper sits in a productive lineage: it pushes past the old structuralist separation of “grammar” from “society” and aligns with functionalist/usage‑based work that has tried to show how interactional practice leaves a grammatical residue. That is a welcome move. At the same time, you may want to signal more explicitly that you are re‑stitching a seam that earlier traditions already worried about—onomastics, anthropological linguistics on taboo, and classic discussions of the name/common‑noun divide. Framing the intervention as a new causal bridge is strongest when it’s positioned as a corrective to a split in the discipline’s history rather than as a discovery that no one has ever approached.

On the causal story itself, the boldest claim is that taboo drives frequency which drives syntax. Historically, that is plausible, but it also invites the question of diachrony: when did bare “Mom/Dad” first become stable in English, and is the taboo synchronous with that stabilization? Without some historical evidence, the explanation risks looking like a synchronic rationalization. It might help to add a small diachronic sidebar—orthographic evidence (capitalization), quotations in letters or diaries, or corpora showing the rise of bare kin terms—to anchor the mechanism in time. Also, the role of baby‑talk phonology and register (Mom/Mum vs Mother) is likely entangled with entrenchment; acknowledging that would refine the account.

On the syntax–sociolinguistics interface, the paper leans heavily on CGEL’s category–function distinctions and on vocatives as a bridging context. That’s fine, but the sociolinguistic side could be more interactionally specific. Address terms are not only “slots” but stance‑taking devices with rich indexicality; this is where the meaning of “Mom” as a term of identity is negotiated. I would encourage bringing in the metapragmatic layer: how speakers discuss and police address terms, how “first‑name” talk becomes a tool for renegotiating family relationships. This would make the argument less like a one‑way mapping from social norm to syntax and more like a bidirectional interface where grammar, ideology, and interaction co‑constitute one another.

From a language‑and‑identity perspective, the biggest blind spot is variation and contestation. The argument leans on a single “mainstream Anglophone” norm, but address practices vary by class, region, ethnicity, religious community, family structure, and by queer and adoptive kinship arrangements. Those variations are not peripheral; they are exactly where identities are negotiated. The taboo itself is an ideological construct with gendered and power‑laden implications. If “Mom/Dad” functions as a name, it is a name that fixes a relational identity; for some speakers that is affirming, for others it is resisted. This is a fertile place to make the identity implications explicit.

Constructively, I’d suggest a modest expansion on three fronts: (1) add a diachronic or historical‑corpus vignette to ground the grammaticalization claim; (2) add a short section on sociolinguistic variation and identity work around kin‑address, including communities where the taboo is weakened or reconfigured; and (3) make explicit how you see the paper aligning with, and correcting, the discipline’s historical tendency to separate “structure” from “social meaning.” That would strengthen the historical positioning, sharpen the causal claim, and show how identity is not merely an epiphenomenon but part of the grammatical story.
