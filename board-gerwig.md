The Parent Trap framing does land emotionally for me — it’s a clean, cinematic hook that makes the abstract claim feel bodily. But the paper treats the moment almost like a thesis illustration rather than a lived scene. As a filmmaker, I want one more beat of texture: the awkwardness of the pause before “Dad,” the relief on his face, the way the word changes the air in the room. If you linger there for just a sentence or two, the reader can feel the charge of the taboo before you pivot into analysis.

On the relational dimension, the paper is strong on power/solidarity and on the social prohibition itself, but it understates how naming is negotiated minute‑to‑minute in real families. The shift from “Mommy” to “Mom,” the weaponized “Mother,” the deliberate first‑name slip in an argument — those are relational moves, not just grammatical facts. Bringing in that relational choreography would deepen your claim that naming is a licensed stance of affiliation, not merely a referential mechanism.

What’s missing from the human story is the messy range of families where the taboo is unstable: step‑parents, adoption, estrangement, queer or chosen families, families split across languages. Those contexts are where the naming rules feel most alive — not as a uniform social law, but as a negotiated contract. Even a brief acknowledgment (or a tiny vignette) would show that the mechanism you propose has stakes and variation, not just neat causality.

Constructively, I’d consider a short interlude or paragraph that stays with the emotional arc: how a word can restore a relationship, not just denote it. Thread The Parent Trap moment lightly through the paper instead of only at the bookends, so the human thread doesn’t vanish once the apparatus arrives. The analysis is strong; it just needs a bit more flesh so the reader feels, not only understands, why this naming prohibition matters.
