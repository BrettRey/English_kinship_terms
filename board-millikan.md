From a Millikan-style teleosemantic perspective, the paper’s central bridge—taboo → address frequency → proper‑name syntax—is promising, but it needs a clearer story about the *proper functions* of the relevant linguistic devices. Proper functions are etiological: they derive from stabilized success in a lineage of use. You currently motivate the shift largely with entrenchment and distribution; I’d like to see the *consumer* side more explicit: what receiver responses are being selected for and stabilized (recognition of the right individual, attention‑getting, deference display, etc.). In teleosemantics, a form’s “meaning” is pinned to the normal conditions under which it does its job. So if “Mom” has acquired proper‑name status, specify its proper function in terms of coordination under family‑domain normal conditions, not just its bare‑NP distribution.

Can proper functions explain the grammaticalization you posit? Yes—in principle. A proper‑function story would say that tokens of “Mom” in address and reference are reproduced and selected because they reliably secure a particular coordination outcome (hearer identifies *this* caregiver; hearer recognizes the speaker’s deference role), and that this stabilizes a device whose *proper function* is name‑like identification within a family domain. But the paper needs to show the genealogical mechanism: how children learn, how correction and uptake enforce a stable reproducing line of use, and how “normal conditions” are fixed (e.g., one salient mother in the speech community, a stable family lexicon). If you make those learning and correction dynamics explicit, then “proper function” becomes a genuine explanation of the grammaticalization rather than a label for a distributional fact.

Is the “sedimented behavior” framing compatible with teleosemantics? It can be, but only if “sediment” is treated as the historical residue of *selected, reproduced* practices, not mere frequency‑based entrenchment. In my terms, sediment must be tied to the reproduction of a conventional device whose success keeps it in circulation. I’d recommend reframing the Bybee line so that entrenchment is *evidence* of a stabilized conventional function, not the explanation itself. This would make your usage‑based mechanism teleosemantically respectable: the taboo creates a stable ecological niche for a device; the device’s success in that niche gives it a proper function; the grammar is a downstream crystallization of that function.

A teleosemantic critique also suggests you separate two functions that you currently fold together: (i) vocative “Mom!” as a directive signal to get attention, and (ii) referential “Mom called” as an indicative signal to enable identification. Those are different consumer roles, even if they share a form. The paper says “not polysemy,” but teleosemantics allows a single device to have multiple proper functions if its lineage stabilizes multiple consumer responses. It would strengthen your account to show how vocative success *feeds* the stabilization of referential use, rather than assuming vocatives automatically generalize to proper‑name reference.

Finally, I’d push for more explicit *normal‑condition* tests and failure cases. Teleosemantics predicts that misuse and malfunction illuminate function: cases with two “moms,” step‑parents, adoptive families, or communities where first‑name address is acceptable should reveal pressure points. You already gesture at cross‑linguistic predictions; I’d add a brief teleosemantic rationale for why the taboo is a stabilizer rather than the function itself, and suggest a small empirical strategy (child‑directed speech correction episodes; diary or corpus evidence of vocative vs referential ratios). That will let you say not just that grammar is “sedimented,” but *why* the sediment looks the way it does in teleosemantic terms.
