# Advisory Board

Imagined consultants whose work informs this paper's approach to connecting naming taboo and syntax.

## Members

### Joan Bybee
**Usage-based grammar; frequency effects**

The core argument depends on Bybee's insight that frequency drives grammaticalization. High-frequency use of kinship terms in address position (because first names are taboo) should produce exactly the kind of entrenchment and autonomy we see in their proper-noun-like syntax.

- *Frequency of Use and the Organization of Language* (2007)

### Elizabeth Traugott
**Grammaticalization theory**

Traugott's work on how pragmatic functions become grammatical properties provides the theoretical backbone. The paper argues for a pathway: social prohibition → pragmatic function (address) → grammatical property (bare singular licensing).

- *Grammaticalization* with Hopper (1993) and Trousdale (2013)

### Penelope Brown
**Politeness theory; social motivations for linguistic form**

Brown & Levinson's framework explains *why* the taboo exists (encoding power/solidarity through asymmetric address). The paper extends this to show how social motivation shapes grammatical form.

- *Politeness: Some Universals in Language Usage* with Levinson (1987)

### John Joseph
**History of linguistics; language and identity**

Joseph's work on how linguistics has handled (and mishandled) the intersection of social practice and linguistic structure. Also relevant: his treatment of naming and identity.

- *Language and Identity* (2004)
- *Saussure* (2012)

### Peter Godfrey-Smith
**Philosophy of biology; signals and natural categories**

Thinking about kinship terms as a natural category with clustered properties (HPC-style) benefits from Godfrey-Smith's approach to biological categories and signaling systems.

- *Philosophy of Biology* (2014)
- *Other Minds* (2016)

### Ruth Millikan
**Teleosemantics; proper functions and convention**

Millikan's account of how conventions stabilize and acquire "proper functions" helps explain how a social prohibition can become grammaticalized. The taboo creates a stable pattern; the pattern acquires grammatical status.

- *Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories* (1984)
- *Language: A Biological Model* (2005)

### Carl Zimmer
**Science writing; making the abstract concrete**

Zimmer models the expository strategy this paper needs: lead with concrete examples, let the theory emerge from observation. His writing on heredity and biological categories is also substantively relevant.

- *She Has Her Mother's Laugh* (2018)
- *Life's Edge* (2021)

### Greta Gerwig
**Director; family naming and identity**

*Lady Bird* (2017) is a 90-minute meditation on what we call each other in families. Christine insists on "Lady Bird"; her mother refuses. The film shows viscerally what the paper argues theoretically: naming in families carries weight that shapes identity and relationship.

- *Lady Bird* (2017)
