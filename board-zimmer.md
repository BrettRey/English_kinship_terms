The exposition has a strong, cinematic hook, and the concrete‑to‑abstract move is promising: the *Parent Trap* scene gives you a live nerve and a clear emotional stake before you pivot to the grammatical puzzle. That said, the structure only partly delivers on that promise. You go from vivid narrative to dense metalanguage very quickly, and the reader who came in on the human scene may feel the floor drop out under them once CGEL terminology and category/function distinctions arrive. As a science writer, I’d keep the narrative thread audible through the whole introduction—either by returning to a short, everyday scene every few paragraphs or by keeping one or two plain‑English examples in the running text that keep the “what this sounds like in real life” constantly in view.

The basic phenomenon can be made more intuitive for general readers by slowing down the explanation of “bare singulars.” Right now the key contrast is presented in linguist‑style examples, with abbreviations and graded judgments. For non‑specialists, rewrite this as a small mini‑story (“You can say ‘Mom called,’ but you can’t say ‘Neighbor called’ unless you add *the* or *my*…”) and briefly explain what “bare” means in ordinary language. This is also a place to add one or two conversational snippets (e.g., a sibling talking to another sibling about “Mom” versus a stranger talking about “my mom”), so the reader hears the shift rather than seeing it in notation. You can always keep the formal examples for the academic audience, but the first pass should be auditory and human.

The concrete‑to‑abstract structure would land better if the most technical scaffolding arrived later. The CGEL table and the “deitality” discussion read like a deep dive that arrives before you’ve fully earned it with concrete texture. Consider moving the table to a later section or a boxed sidebar, and delay “deitality” until you’ve established the mechanism and the stakes. A simpler bridge could be: “We can treat ‘Mom’ as a name in some positions and as a kinship noun in others; CGEL has labels for this distinction.” Let the reader live with the idea before you give them the taxonomy. The more abstract the term, the later it should come.

To make the piece more accessible, I’d reduce citation density in the introduction and reserve the dense literature review for later. You’re already narrating a social rule that most readers recognize; you can let that familiarity do some work. Add a paragraph that invites readers to test the claim in their own lives, and acknowledge variation (“some families use first names, especially in X contexts”) so readers don’t feel scolded by the word “taboo.” This is also a place to add a contemporary example (a recent film, a social media clip, a personal anecdote) so the opening feels less like a lecture and more like observation.

Finally, the causal chain is compelling, but a few claims need tightening for a general audience. The “30–50 uses per day” estimate reads confident but ungrounded; either cite a source, label it explicitly as a rough illustrative estimate, or move it to a footnote. Similarly, words like “engine,” “sediment,” and “grammaticalization highway” are evocative, but there are many of them—pick one or two and stick with them so the metaphors don’t compete. If you can add one sentence about what would count as disconfirming evidence (e.g., a community with strong taboo but weak bare‑singular use), you’ll feel more empirically grounded and less purely rhetorical.
