Here is the advisory board's feedback on the current draft of "English Kinship Terms: From Taboo to Syntax".

### 1. JOAN BYBEE (Usage-based Grammar)
**Status:** **Strong Core Argument, Weak Data Support**

*   **Frequency Argument:** The intuition is sound—frequency drives entrenchment. However, your estimate of "30--50 uses per day" (Section 1.2) feels like a "back-of-the-envelope" guess. To be rigorous, you need to cite CHILDES data or similar acquisition corpora. Does the frequency *actually* dwarf other high-frequency nouns?
*   **The Mechanism:** I appreciate the "sedimented behavior" citation, but you need to be more precise about the *type* of frequency. Is it just token frequency? You argue that the *vocative* slot entrenchment bleeds into *argument* position. This is a big leap. `Waiter` is high frequency in vocative, yet we don't say `*Waiter is coming` (as a proper name). You address this in 6.1, but the "sustained frequency" argument needs to be stronger. The "taboo" doesn't just increase frequency; it *eliminates the competitor* (the First Name). That total displacement is what's unique, not just the raw count. Emphasize that.
*   **Blind Spot:** You mention parents using names for children, but you missed a huge frequency source: Parents referring to *themselves* as "Mommy/Daddy" to the child ("Mommy's going to the store"). This input frequency is massive and crucial for the child's acquisition of the term as a proper name.

### 2. ELIZABETH TRAUGOTT (Grammaticalization)
**Status:** **Convincing Pathway, Categorization Questions**

*   **The Pathway:** Your 4-stage pathway (Relational -> Vocative -> Bare Argument -> Proper Name) is plausible. However, is this *grammaticalization* (a lexical item becoming a grammatical marker) or *lexicalization* (a specific instance becoming a frozen unit)? You argue for a "constructional/status analysis," which saves it from being pure lexicalization, but you need to be careful with terms.
*   **Bridging Context:** Section 4.2 identifies the "vocative" as the bridging context. This is smart. In the vocative, the determiner is absent for *pragmatic* reasons, allowing the listener to reanalyze the absence as *syntactic* (proper name status). You should explicitly label this as "reanalysis."
*   **Missing Historical Depth:** Has this changed over time? Did "Mother" function as a proper name in the 18th century more or less than "Mom" does now? A brief nod to the historical stability (or instability) of this taboo would strengthen the claim that this is a long-term grammaticalization process, not just a synchronic quirk.

### 3. PENELOPE BROWN (Politeness Theory)
**Status:** **Solid Theoretical Base, Needs Nuance**

*   **Face-Threat Analysis:** The analysis of "Mom" vs. "Sarah" as a face-threat is correct. However, "solidarity" (Section 2.1) might be too broad. The taboo is specifically about *deference* and *intimacy*. Using a First Name can be a claim of equality (threatening the deference hierarchy) or a claim of distance (threatening the intimacy bond).
*   **The "Taboo" Label:** You call it a "taboo." In linguistics/anthropology, that's a heavy word. It works for the dramatic argument, but ensure you acknowledge that for many modern families, this is a *soft constraint* or a *register preference*, not a hard anthropological taboo like the Polynesian origins of the term.
*   **Sociopragmatic Strengthening:** You claim the asymmetry is robust. You should acknowledge the "Baby Talk" register where parents use Kinship Terms for *themselves* (see Bybee's point). This is a solidarity-building move that reinforces the "Kin Term = Name" equation.

### 4. JOHN JOSEPH (History & Identity)
**Status:** **Excellent Interface Work, Watch the "Gap"**

*   **The "Gap":** You claim "Nobody has connected these facts." Be careful. The disconnect between sociolinguistics (parole) and syntax (langue) is the defining feature of 20th-century linguistics. This paper is a nice bridge, but frame it as overcoming a disciplinary structural problem, not just an oversight.
*   **Identity:** The "Parent Trap" hook is excellent because it highlights *identity*. The choice of "Dad" constructs the father *as* a father.
*   **Blind Spots:** What about adults who *do* call their parents by first name? Does the syntax crumble? If I call my mom "Susan," do I also start saying "The Susan is coming"? Likely not. This suggests the grammaticalization is communal/dialectal, not just idiolectal. You touch on this, but the tension between individual choice and community grammar needs more airtime.

### 5. PETER GODFREY-SMITH (Philosophy of Biology/HPC)
**Status:** **Good Categorization, Needs "Signaling" Work**

*   **HPC Angle:** The "Gradience" section (3.3) screams Homeostatic Property Cluster (HPC). "Kinship Terms" aren't a sharp category; they are a cluster of properties (vocative freq, unique ref, bare syntax) held together by the causal mechanism of the taboo. Explicitly citing HPC theory (Boyd/Godfrey-Smith) would give your gradience argument philosophical rigor.
*   **Signaling:** Why does the signaling system stabilize on the bare form? Because "My Mom" signals a *description* of a relation, whereas "Mom" signals the *recognition* of an individual. The bare form signals "We are in the same family circle." It's an efficient code for shared context.

### 6. RUTH MILLIKAN (Teleosemantics)
**Status:** **Compatible, but Is it "Proper Function"?**

*   **Proper Function:** Does the bare singular form have a "proper function"? Yes. It functions to identify the referent *while simultaneously indexing the family domain*. The determiner ("my mom") performs the identification but fails the indexing.
*   **Sedimented Behavior:** The "sediment" metaphor works well with a teleosemantic view. The "taboo" provides the selection pressure. Forms that violate it are weeded out (correction/social cost). Forms that adhere to it (bare KTs) reproduce.
*   **Critique:** Is the syntax *actually* functional, or is it a "spandrel" (a byproduct) of the frequency? You argue it's entrenchment (byproduct). I would argue it has stabilized because it *is* functional—it marks the "insider" perspective efficiently.

### 7. CARL ZIMMER (Science Communication)
**Status:** **Great Hook, Heavy Middle**

*   **Exposition:** The *Parent Trap* intro is stellar. It grabs the reader immediately.
*   **The Slump:** Section 1.4 ("Deitality") and parts of Section 3 get very heavy on the CGEL jargon ("existential pivots," "identificational constructions"). If this is for a general linguistic audience, you need to unpack "deitality" more gently or cut it if it's not essential to the core "Taboo -> Syntax" argument. It feels like a subplot from another paper.
*   **Accessibility:** The "Gradience" list (Mom > Uncle > Cousin) is good. Make it more concrete. Give us a sentence like `*Cousin is late` and explain *why* it sounds weird to a native ear (it sounds like you're talking about a generic abstract cousin, or a monk).

### 8. GRETA GERWIG (Director/Narrative)
**Status:** **Emotional Core is Strong, Missed "In-Law" Drama**

*   **The Emotional Hook:** The "Nick" vs. "Dad" conflict is the perfect emotional anchor. It grounds the linguistics in human stakes.
*   **Missed Opportunity:** You talk about parents and children. But the *highest* drama for this naming taboo often happens with **In-Laws**. When do you start calling your mother-in-law "Mom"? It's a huge threshold. If you do, does the syntax change? (e.g., "Mom is coming" vs "Your mom is coming"). Including a nod to this adult navigation of the taboo would make the paper resonate even more.
*   **The Ending:** The return to *The Parent Trap* in the conclusion is satisfying. "The syntax is the sediment" is a beautiful line. Don't lose it.
