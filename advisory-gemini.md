**Joan Bybee:** "Don't just claim the connection; show the mechanism of repetition. Emphasize that it is the sheer frequency of 'Mom' and 'Dad' in the vocative slot—driven by that social taboo—that automates their storage as unanalyzed, proper-noun-like chunks in the speaker's mind. Avoid treating the syntax as a set of abstract rules that 'allow' this; instead, argue that the grammar *is* the sedimented behavior."

**Elizabeth Traugott:** "You need to map the specific trajectory of change, focusing on the 'bridging contexts' where the reanalysis happens. Show us the ambiguous utterances where a term functions plausibly as both a descriptive noun and a respectful address, because that is where the pragmatic social pressure fossilizes into semantic constraints. Be careful not to suggest this is a finished process; look for evidence of gradience where the grammaticalization is still partial."

**Penelope Brown:** "Keep the power dynamic central—don't let the formal syntax obscure the face-threatening act that drives the whole system. Remind your reader that every time a child uses 'Mom' instead of a first name, they are actively doing 'social work' to maintain the hierarchy, and it's this constant social pressure that gives the linguistic form its durability. The pitfall to avoid is making the social factor seem like mere background context; it is the engine."

**John Joseph:** "Frame this as a critique of the 20th-century disciplinary siloing that allowed such an obvious connection to go unnoticed. Use this paper to question why linguistics has been so content to separate the 'social speaker' from the 'grammatical subject.' Success here means convincing the reader that you can't actually understand the grammar of English nouns without understanding the politics of the English family."

**Peter Godfrey-Smith:** "Treat 'kinship terms' not as a rigid logical class with necessary and sufficient conditions, but as a Homeostatic Property Cluster where social function and grammatical form reinforce each other to keep the category stable. Don't get hung up on edge cases that don't fit perfectly; biology and language rarely produce perfect types. Focus on how the system regulates itself to handle the coordination problem of referring to close kin."

**Ruth Millikan:** "Focus on the 'stabilizing function' of the convention: the taboo persists because it solves a coordination problem in the family, and the syntax adapts to support that solution. Ask what the 'proper function' of the bare singular form is in this specific lineage of usage. Avoid describing the rule as an arbitrary constraint; describe it as a survival strategy for the linguistic item."

**Carl Zimmer:** "Please, do not start with a definition of 'weak proper names' or a citation from 1960. Start with a scene—a child correcting themselves, or that awkward moment when you don't know what to call your mother-in-law—something that makes the reader feel the taboo viscerally before you dissect it. The science of the syntax will land much harder if you've already hooked us with the biology of the family."

**Greta Gerwig:** "This is about the drama of intimacy; 'Mom' isn't just a noun, it's a role you're casting someone in every time you say it. Make sure your examples feel like real dialogue, not textbook sentences—capture the friction and the love in that 'bare singular.' If you write this entirely as a technical manual, you miss the heartbeat of why we care about these words in the first place."
