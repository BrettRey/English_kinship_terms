# English kinship terms: A genuine gap between taboo and syntax

The scholarly literature on English kinship terms reveals a striking bifurcation: naming taboos occupy sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics, while quasi-name syntactic behavior occupies formal grammar—**and no one has explicitly connected these two phenomena**. This represents a genuine, unexploited gap for a paper arguing that the social prohibition drives the grammatical properties, particularly from a CGEL-framework perspective with careful category-function distinctions.

## The naming taboo literature is surprisingly thin

Despite its cultural salience, the prohibition on English-speaking children calling parents by first name has received remarkably little dedicated scholarly attention. The foundational work comes from **Brown & Gilman's (1960)** "The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity" in Sebeok's *Style in Language*, which established the power/solidarity framework explaining asymmetric address: parents use children's first names while receiving kinship terms in return, encoding generational authority. **Brown & Ford (1961)** extended this to nominal forms in American English in the *Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology*, demonstrating that family-type relationships encode power differentials through the FN/kinship term asymmetry.

The most directly relevant source is **Eleanor Dickey's (1997)** "Forms of Address and Terms of Reference" in *Journal of Linguistics* 33(2):255-274, which found that "virtually all informants addressed their parents with kinship terms" and applied Giles' accommodation theory to explain why adults converge toward children's usage when referring to relatives. **Friederike Braun's (1988)** *Terms of Address* (Mouton de Gruyter) provides comprehensive cross-linguistic synthesis but treats the English pattern descriptively rather than analytically.

The critical observation is that **no monograph or major empirical study** focuses specifically on the English naming taboo. Cross-cultural comparisons show the English convention is relatively weak compared to Chinese imperial naming taboos or Vietnamese kinship systems (documented in sources like Luong's work on Vietnamese person reference). The anthropological kinship literature from **Morgan (1871)** and **Murdock (1949)** classifies English within the "Eskimo" system but addresses terminology typology rather than address prohibitions.

## Syntactic analyses exist but remain disconnected from social function

The grammatical literature on kinship terms' proper-noun-like behavior is more developed, though scattered across discussions of proper nouns, bare nominals, and inalienable possession rather than concentrated in dedicated treatments.

**CGEL (Huddleston & Pullum 2002)** provides the crucial terminological apparatus. It distinguishes proper nouns (single words: "John") from proper names (NPs including proper nouns: "the United Kingdom"), and further distinguishes **strong proper names** (used without articles: *Paris, Mom*) from **weak proper names** (requiring *the*: *the Thames*). When "Mom" appears without a determiner referring to a unique individual, it functions as a strong proper name; with a determiner ("my mom"), it functions as a common noun with relational meaning. This framework—though not applied systematically to kinship terms—provides the analytical tools for the proposed paper.

The **bare singular** pattern is particularly significant. Research on bare nominals (surveyed in Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Linguistics) notes that English "allows bare mass nouns and bare plurals, but not bare singular count nouns (*I bought table)"—yet kinship terms used as names represent a **systematic exception**. Greg Carlson's foundational (1977) work treating bare plurals "as proper names of kinds" provides conceptual parallels. The literature on **inalienable possession** (Chappell & McGregor 1996, *The Grammar of Inalienability*; Nichols 1988 on alienable/inalienable possession) identifies kinship terms as prototypically inalienable possessees alongside body parts, explaining their inherent relationality—though without connecting this to their name-like syntax.

**Virginia Hill's (2022)** "The syntactization of kinship in vocative phrases" in *Glossa* is the most recent directly relevant syntactic work, examining how kinship nouns undergo grammaticalization in vocative phrases and arguing they show "mixed DP/D/N status." However, Hill focuses on "reversed vocatives" (when parents address children using their own kinship term) rather than the naming taboo, and does not make the taboo→syntax connection.

## Nobody has connected the taboo to the syntax

This is the central finding: **no explicit scholarly work argues that the social prohibition on first-name use causes or explains the proper-noun-like syntactic properties of English kinship terms**. The literature treats these as separate phenomena in separate subdisciplines:

- Sociolinguistics documents the address asymmetry through power/solidarity frameworks
- Formal syntax documents the determiner alternation and bare singular behavior
- Neither cites the other; neither proposes a causal mechanism

A thorough search found no functionalist or usage-based analyses from scholars like Givón, Du Bois, or Thompson connecting social function to grammatical form for kinship terms specifically. No grammaticalization studies examine how English kinship terms developed their proper-noun-like properties as a consequence of their address function. There are no cross-references between the sociolinguistics papers (Dickey 1997, Brown & Gilman 1960) and the syntax papers on proper nouns or bare singulars.

The **politeness and grammaticalization literature** demonstrates that such social function→grammatical form pathways exist generally (e.g., Spanish *vuestra merced* → *usted*), but nobody has applied this framework to English kinship terms. This gap is particularly surprising given the obviousness of the potential hypothesis: high-frequency use of kinship terms as address forms (driven by the taboo on first names) could plausibly drive their grammaticalization toward proper-noun-like syntax.

## Recent work (2015-2025) confirms the gap persists

The past decade has seen renewed interest in kinship terminology, but **virtually no construction grammar or systematic syntactic analysis of English kinship terms**:

**Cognitive linguistics semantics** has been active. **Cliff Goddard (2024)** in *Lingua* ("The conceptual building blocks of kinship terminologies") uses Natural Semantic Metalanguage to model kinship term meanings, arguing for a "hybrid biosocial account." **Anna Wierzbicka (2017)** addresses kinship semantics developmentally in *The Semantics of Nouns* (Oxford). However, both focus on semantic structure rather than syntactic behavior, and neither addresses the naming taboo connection.

**Usage-based and corpus approaches** have appeared. **Rácz, Passmore, Sheard & Jordan (2019/2020)** in *Royal Society Open Science* demonstrated a negative correlation between usage frequency and rate of replacement for Indo-European kinship terms—terms like "mother" change slower because they are used more frequently. **Zuraida & Simatupang (2023)** published a rare corpus study of "Mom" and "Dad" collocations in English novels, finding semantic prosody differences, but did not address syntactic patterns. Neither connects frequency effects to grammatical properties.

**Computational/cognitive modeling** has addressed acquisition. **Mollica & Piantadosi (2022)** in *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review* model kinship term concept acquisition cross-linguistically. **Blythe et al. (2020)** in *Language* 96(3) studied kinship term acquisition in Murrinhpatha, examining "kintax" (morphological encoding of kinship)—demonstrating that grammatical analysis of kinship is possible and providing a methodological model for English.

**Typological work** has produced the **Kinbank database** (Passmore et al. 2023, *PLOS ONE*) with 210,903 kinterms from 1,229 languages. **Caro Reina & Helmbrecht (2022)** produced *Proper Names versus Common Nouns* (De Gruyter), a typological study of proper noun morphosyntax—but kinship terms are not specifically addressed.

The **Oxford Handbook of Construction Grammar** (Hoffmann & Trousdale 2013) contains no chapter on kinship terms. No dissertation or thesis was found applying construction grammar specifically to English kinship terms.

## The gap is real and exploitable

The proposed paper connecting naming taboo→syntax from a CGEL framework would fill a genuine lacuna. The contribution would be:

1. **Bridging two literatures** that have remained disconnected despite obvious relevance to each other
2. **Providing a functionalist explanation** for syntactic facts currently treated as arbitrary (why kinship terms permit bare singular use)
3. **Applying CGEL's careful category-function distinctions** (proper noun vs. proper name, strong vs. weak proper names, determiner vs. bare NP) systematically to kinship terms
4. **Connecting to broader grammaticalization theory** by proposing a mechanism: social prohibition→address function→high frequency in name position→grammaticalization toward proper-name syntax

The paper could argue that children's socially-mandated use of "Mom" and "Dad" as names (because first names are prohibited) creates the frequency and distributional patterns that cause these items to grammaticalize proper-noun-like properties. The CGEL framework provides the descriptive apparatus; the sociolinguistic literature provides the functional motivation; the synthesis would be original.

No existing work makes this argument explicitly. The terrain is open.
