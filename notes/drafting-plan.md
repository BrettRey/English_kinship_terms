# Drafting Plan: English Kinship Terms

**Working title:** English kinship terms: From taboo to syntax
**Target:** Journal article (~8,000 words)
**Core claim:** The English naming taboo (children can't use parents' first names) drives the proper-noun-like syntax of kinship terms through a grammaticalization pathway: social prohibition → address function → high frequency in name position → bare singular licensing.

## 1. Opening: The Scene (Zimmer, Gerwig)

Don't start with definitions. Start with a moment that makes the reader *feel* the taboo.

**Options:**
- A child self-correcting: "Can Sarah— can *Mom* drive me?"
- The mother-in-law problem: what do you call her?
- The *Lady Bird* moment: "My name is Lady Bird." / "Your name is Christine."
- Overhearing a peer call their parent by first name (the visceral wrongness)

**Goal:** 2-3 paragraphs that establish the phenomenon as *felt*, not just described. Real dialogue, not textbook sentences.

---

## 2. The Puzzle: Two Facts That Should Be Connected

**Fact 1 (Sociolinguistic):** English-speaking children virtually never address parents by first name. This is a social prohibition encoding power/solidarity (Brown & Gilman 1960, Dickey 1997).

**Fact 2 (Syntactic):** English kinship terms permit bare singular use (*Mom is here*) where other count nouns don't (**Table is here*). When used this way, they function as strong proper names (CGEL).

**The gap:** Nobody has connected these. The literatures don't cite each other. No causal mechanism proposed.

**Framing (Joseph):** This is a case study in disciplinary siloing. You can't understand the grammar of English nouns without understanding the politics of the English family.

## 3. The CGEL Apparatus: Proper Nouns and Proper Names

Brief, precise exposition of the analytical tools:

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Proper noun | Lexical category (single word) | *John*, *Mom* |
| Proper name | NP functioning as name | *the United Kingdom* |
| Strong proper name | Without article | *Paris*, *Mom* |
| Weak proper name | With *the* | *the Thames* |
| Bare singular | Count noun without determiner | Normally ungrammatical (*table is here*) |

**Key observation:** When *Mom* appears without a determiner referring to a unique individual, it functions as a strong proper name. With a determiner (*my mom*), it functions as a common noun with relational meaning.

**Contrast with ordinary nouns:**
- *Mom called.* (grammatical)
- *Teacher called.* (marginal/ungrammatical without context)
- *Neighbor called.* (ungrammatical)

What licenses bare singular *Mom* but not *neighbor*?

## 4. The Mechanism: From Taboo to Syntax (Bybee, Traugott, Brown)

This is the heart of the paper. Show how the social prohibition produces the grammatical property.

### 4.1 The Frequency Argument (Bybee)

The taboo forces high-frequency use of kinship terms in vocative/address position:
- Children say *Mom* hundreds of thousands of times
- Each use is in a slot prototypically occupied by names
- Repetition → entrenchment → storage as unanalyzed chunk
- Grammar is "sedimented behavior," not abstract rules that "allow" exceptions

**Corpus evidence needed:** Frequency of *Mom/Dad* in COCA, especially in dialogue. Compare to *mother/father*.

### 4.2 The Grammaticalization Trajectory (Traugott)

Map the pathway:

1. **Source:** Relational noun (*my mother*)
2. **Bridging context:** Address/vocative use (*Mother, can you...*)
3. **Extension:** Referential use in name position (*Mother called*)
4. **Target:** Strong proper name with bare singular licensing

**Key point (Traugott):** Look for evidence of gradience. This isn't a completed process:
- *Grandma* more name-like than *grandmother*
- *Mom* more name-like than *mother*
- Regional/register variation in acceptability

### 4.3 The Social Engine (Brown)

The power dynamic isn't background—it's the engine:
- Every use of *Mom* instead of first name is social work
- The child is doing deference, maintaining hierarchy
- This constant pressure gives the form its durability
- The face-threatening nature of FN use ensures the taboo persists

## 5. The Homeostatic Property Cluster (Godfrey-Smith, Millikan)

Frame kinship terms as an HPC kind, not a rigid logical class:

**Properties that cluster:**
- Relational semantics (inalienable possession)
- Vocative/address function
- Bare singular licensing
- Unique reference within family
- Power-encoded asymmetry

**Homeostatic mechanism:** Social taboo → address frequency → proper-name syntax → reinforces unique reference → stabilizes the taboo

**Millikan's question:** What is the "proper function" of bare singular *Mom*? It's a survival strategy: the form that solves the coordination problem of referring to close kin gets grammatical privileges.

Don't worry about edge cases (Godfrey-Smith). Biology and language rarely produce perfect types.

## 6. Cross-Linguistic Perspective

The English taboo is "weak" compared to other languages:
- Chinese imperial naming taboos (much stronger)
- Vietnamese kinship systems (elaborate)
- Some cultures permit FN use for parents

**Prediction:** Languages with stronger naming taboos should show even more robust proper-name syntax for kinship terms. Languages without the taboo should show less.

(Note: This section can be brief—gesture toward testable predictions, acknowledge limits of the present paper.)

## 7. Objections and Replies

**Objection 1:** Other nouns can be used bare in vocatives (*Waiter!*). Why is kinship special?

**Reply:** Vocative use alone doesn't produce referential bare singular licensing. *Waiter is here* is ungrammatical. The difference is *frequency* of address use, driven by the taboo.

**Objection 2:** This is just about proper names, not kinship specifically.

**Reply:** The analysis explains *why* kinship terms became proper names. The taboo is the causal link. Other proper names (place names, personal names) have different pathways.

**Objection 3:** What about *sir*, *ma'am*, which permit bare use?

**Reply:** These are also high-frequency address forms with similar grammaticalization pressures. The analysis generalizes appropriately.

## 8. Conclusion

Restate the contribution:
1. **Bridged two literatures** that ignored each other
2. **Proposed a causal mechanism:** taboo → frequency → grammaticalization
3. **Applied CGEL's apparatus** systematically to kinship terms
4. **Connected to broader theory:** HPC kinds, proper functions, usage-based grammar

End with something concrete—circle back to the opening scene.

## Writing Principles (House Style + Advisory Board)

- **Concrete before abstract:** Examples first, then terminology
- **Short paragraphs:** ~60 words average, max 100
- **Contractions:** Use them
- **No throat-clearers:** "It is important to note that..." → delete
- **Real dialogue:** Not textbook sentences
- **Show the mechanism:** Don't just claim the connection
- **Keep the social engine visible:** Power dynamics aren't background

## Next Actions

1. Write the opening scene (Section 1)
2. Draft Section 4 (the mechanism) as the core
3. Pull corpus data on *Mom/Dad* frequency
4. Fill in remaining sections
5. Revise for voice and flow
