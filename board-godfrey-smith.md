As a philosophy‑of‑biology reader, I see a clear HPC (homeostatic property cluster) angle, but it’s only implicit right now. You already have a cluster of properties—bare NP syntax, vocative dominance, family‑domain identifiability, resistance to modification, and strong affective/sociolinguistic constraints—and you have a stabilizing mechanism (taboo → usage frequency → entrenchment). That is structurally an HPC story, but you need to say so explicitly and draw the contrast with “natural kind” talk: this is a social/linguistic kind whose homeostasis is maintained by norms, not by biological reproduction. If you articulate the cluster and the homeostatic mechanism in one short subsection, the HPC framing will read as a principled theoretical claim rather than a metaphor. It also gives you a sharper way to interpret gradience: partial membership in the cluster is expected in an HPC, so the Aunt/Uncle/Grandma gradient isn’t just descriptive, it’s predicted.

On natural categories and signaling, your material wants a signaling‑system framing but doesn’t quite commit. The taboo is not just a “cause” of frequency; it is a norm that stabilizes a sender‑receiver system in which kin terms signal relational stance (deference, affiliation, entitlement) as well as reference. Framing “Mom” as a conventional signal with a stable social function would connect directly to a Godfrey‑Smith‑style signaling analysis: there’s an equilibrium sustained by coordination and by the costs of mis‑signaling (face‑threat, correction). That would also explain why “Mom” is more than a merely referential term: it is a social signal whose reliability is maintained by sanctioning, which in turn yields the grammaticalization pathway. Right now, the signaling role is suggested by the Parent Trap opening, but you could make it theoretically explicit and use it to justify why “name‑like” syntax should track social norm strength.

On philosophical rigor: the causal chain (taboo → frequency → entrenchment → syntax) is plausible but under‑evidenced in its current form, and the frequency numbers read as illustrative rather than empirical. In a philosophy‑of‑biology context, you’ll be expected to separate mechanism from correlational narrative: What exact evidence would show that the taboo is the causal driver rather than a parallel correlate? Can you operationalize “taboo strength” and “name‑like syntax” so that the predicted cross‑community variation is testable? Similarly, you should confront the strongest alternative—semantics of uniqueness and role‑anchored definites—with more diagnostic precision (e.g., concrete tests that would distinguish frequency‑driven entrenchment from a purely semantic licensing). These are manageable additions: one brief methodological paragraph and a more explicit set of falsifiers would noticeably tighten the argument.

Finally, if you do adopt the HPC frame, you should clarify whether you’re claiming a genuine “natural category” or a social kind with real‑pattern status. The latter fits your data better, and it avoids over‑stretching biological analogies. It also lets you incorporate Millikan‑style teleosemantics without sliding into a naive functionalism: the “proper function” of the term can be cast as a stabilized social signal, not a biologically selected trait. I’d suggest a short bridge section stating that this is an HPC‑like social kind produced by a signaling‑norm mechanism, and then using that to tighten your predictions and your falsifiability claims. That would make the philosophy‑of‑biology angle explicit and raise the theoretical rigor without changing the empirical core.
