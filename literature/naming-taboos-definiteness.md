# Languages with naming taboos and grammaticalized definiteness

The canonical naming-taboo languages of East and Southeast Asia—Mandarin, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean—indeed lack definite articles. However, numerous counterexamples exist across Australian Aboriginal, Austronesian, African, and Indigenous American language families where robust naming taboo systems co-occur with grammaticalized definiteness. This survey identifies **16 languages** with documented evidence for both features.

## Australian Aboriginal languages lead the typological overlap

Four Pama-Nyungan languages of Australia demonstrate the clearest co-occurrence, with **Dyirbal** representing the most extensively documented case. Spoken in North Queensland, Dyirbal maintains an elaborate mother-in-law avoidance register called *Jalnguy* (or Dyalŋuy), requiring speakers to use an entirely different lexicon when within hearing range of taboo relatives—mother-in-law, child-in-law, and certain cross-cousins. The avoidance vocabulary shows one-to-many correspondence with everyday speech, where a single generic term replaces multiple specific words. Death name prohibitions also apply, following broader Cape York Peninsula practices.

Dyirbal's definiteness marking operates through **noun markers** (*bayi*, *balan*, *balam*, *bala*) functioning as gender-inflected definite articles. These free-standing elements precede nouns, inflect for case, and agree with four noun classes—masculine humans and most animals (*bayi*), feminine humans and danger-related items (*balan*), non-flesh edibles (*balam*), and a residual category (*bala*). R.M.W. Dixon's landmark 1972 grammar and 2022 revision document both features comprehensively.

**Warlpiri** of the Northern Territory combines mother-in-law speech registers with widows' communication taboos—traditionally, widows were banned from speaking during extended mourning, using only Warlpiri Sign Language. Death names trigger 'Kumantjayi' substitute forms. Bittner and Hale's 1995 paper "Remarks on Definiteness in Warlpiri" in *Quantification in Natural Languages* explicitly analyzes grammaticalized definiteness through demonstratives and pronominal clitics.

**Guugu Yimithirr** (Cape York Peninsula) maintains brother-in-law speech requiring complete vocabulary substitution, plus total silence in mother-in-law's presence. Its demonstrative system contributes definiteness-related functions, documented in Haviland's 1979 grammar.

## Polynesian languages inherit tapu and articles from common ancestry

The strongest Austronesian cases come from Polynesian languages, where the *tapu* concept (source of English "taboo" via Tongan) creates systematic naming restrictions alongside well-developed article systems.

**Hawaiian** maintained an elaborate *kapu* system forbidding commoners from speaking names of high-ranking chiefs (*ali'i*) or looking directly at them—violations often meant immediate death. Death-related taboos restricted naming of the deceased. Hawaiian's article system includes definite **ke/ka** (singular, phonologically conditioned) and **nā** (plural), with indefinite **he**. Elbert and Pukui's *Hawaiian Grammar* (1979) describes both phenomena.

**Māori** preserves strong *tapu* restrictions: speaking names of recently deceased is restricted, burial grounds (*urupā*) remain tapu, and elaborate *tangihanga* funeral rites govern naming practices. Chiefs' names receive special ceremonial treatment. The article system uses definite **te** (singular) and **ngā** (plural), with indefinite **he**.

**Tongan** contributed the English word "taboo" from Captain Cook's 1777 visit. Chiefly registers avoid direct reference to high-ranked persons; formal apologies precede addressing superiors; titles substitute for personal names. Tongan employs a sophisticated three-level article system: definite **e/he**, indefinite **ha**, plus a distinctive "definitive accent" marking definiteness through stress shift. Svenja Völkel's 2023 work in *Personal Names and Naming from an Anthropological-Linguistic Perspective* documents both features.

**Malagasy** practices **teknonymy** extensively—the Zafimaniry refer to adults as "father/mother of X" rather than by personal name, documented by Maurice Bloch (2006). The complex *fady* taboo system governs various naming restrictions. Definiteness marking uses obligatory **ny** for subjects and anaphoric **ilay** for previously mentioned referents.

## African languages show diverse strategies for both features

**Zulu's hlonipha** represents Africa's most extensively documented naming taboo. Married women must avoid in-laws' names, but crucially, *any syllables* from forbidden names must also be avoided throughout regular vocabulary—requiring systematic word substitution. If a father-in-law is named *U-Phepha* ("paper"), his daughter-in-law uses *ili-Khasi* ("leaf") instead. Historically, royal names triggered nation-wide taboos.

Zulu marks definiteness through the **augment** (pre-prefix or initial vowel). Forms like *a-ba-ntu* ("the people") contrast with *bantu* ("people/any people"). The augment's presence/absence grammatically encodes the definite/indefinite distinction, documented in Adams (2010) and Halpert (2015).

**Akan** (Twi/Fante) employs **death-prevention names** (*bagyina*/*apεntεdin*) when mothers experience repeated child mortality. Children receive deliberately unpleasant names—from dangerous animals, filthy places like *Ntomago* ("rag"), or tabooed objects like *Praye* ("broom")—to make them unattractive to spirits. Agyekum's 2006 paper in *Nordic Journal of African Studies* documents extensive verbal taboos.

Akan's post-nominal definite article **nó** encodes familiarity rather than uniqueness—required for anaphoric reference but disallowed at first mention. Arkoh and Matthewson's 2013 *Lingua* paper provides detailed semantic analysis.

**Amharic** practices **teknonymy** throughout Ethiopian culture: parents become "Father/Mother of X" (*Ye Nuro Abbat/Enat*). Related Kambaata (Cushitic) maintains *ballishsha*, an in-law avoidance system paralleling Zulu hlonipha. Amharic's suffixal definite article (*-u/-w* masculine, *-wa* feminine) derives unusually from possessive markers rather than demonstratives, analyzed in Beermann and Ephrem (2007) and Kramer's Georgetown work.

## Na-Dene languages dominate American examples

The **Athabaskan family** shows the strongest American co-occurrence pattern, with death-related naming taboos linked to ghost beliefs.

**Navajo** strictly prohibits speaking deceased persons' names, believed to summon the malevolent **chindi** ghost causing illness or death. Traditional Navajos burn homes where death occurred, avoid enclosed spaces associated with death, and refuse to discuss the dead at all. Young and Morgan's 1987 *Navajo Language* grammar documents the taboos alongside an unusual definiteness pattern: the language marks *indefiniteness* with prefix *a-*, while definiteness is the unmarked default—typologically uncommon.

**Apache (Chiricahua/Mescalero)** maintains even stronger prohibitions. Morris Opler's 1941 *An Apache Life-Way* documents that "nothing is more insulting, provocative, and certain to precipitate conflict than to call out the name of a dead man in the presence of his relative"—feuds and deaths resulted from violations. When someone dies, all children's names in the family are changed. If deceased shared names with common objects, alternative object names were created. Apache informants deliberately omitted deceased relatives from genealogies to avoid speaking their names.

**Tlingit** (sister branch to Athabaskan) transmits names as valuable property through potlatch ceremonies. Memorial potlatch occurs 1-2 years after death, formally transferring names to relatives and releasing the family from mourning restrictions. Names are syntactically unusual—"it is inadmissible for a name to be possessed by another noun." Definiteness is grammatically significant: the ergative postposition **-ch** specifically marks agents with definite objects, creating split-ergative alignment conditioned by definiteness.

**K'iche' (Mayan)** traditionally assigned **day-sign names** from the 260-day ritual calendar, with name changes at puberty and marriage. Ancestral name cycling (grandfather→grandson) transmitted spiritual fortune. K'iche' employs three determiners—**ri**, **le**, and **we**—distinguished by definiteness degree, familiarity, and speaker proximity.

## Typological patterns across language families

Three distinct strategies emerge for combining naming taboos with definiteness marking:

| Strategy | Languages | Taboo Type | Definiteness Form |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Free article + death/status taboo | Hawaiian, Māori, Tongan, K'iche' | Death names, royal/chiefly | Pre-nominal free articles |
| Bound article + in-law avoidance | Zulu, Amharic, Dyirbal | Syllable-level avoidance | Augment/prefix/suffix |
| Demonstrative-derived + ceremonial | Tlingit, Akan, Warlpiri | Potlatch/death-prevention | Grammaticalized demonstratives |

Geographic clustering proves significant. Australian Aboriginal languages concentrate naming taboos in North Queensland, Cape York, and Central Australia—precisely where Dixon identifies robust article-like noun marker systems. Polynesian languages inherit both *tapu* and article systems from Proto-Polynesian, explaining uniform co-occurrence. Athabaskan languages share death-ghost beliefs alongside marked-indefinite systems across the Na-Dene family.

## Conclusion

The assumption that naming taboos and grammaticalized definiteness are typologically incompatible reflects sampling bias toward East Asian exemplars. At least **16 languages across 10 families**—Pama-Nyungan, Gunwinyguan, Oceanic, Barito, Nguni, Ethio-Semitic, Kwa, Na-Dene, and Mayan—demonstrate co-occurrence. The richest documentation exists for Dyirbal (Dixon 1972, 2022), Zulu hlonipha (Irvine and Gunner 2018), Hawaiian-Māori-Tongan tapu (Völkel 2023), and Apache death-name avoidance (Opler 1941). 

The co-occurrence is not random: it clusters in language families where both features have deep historical roots—Proto-Polynesian for Oceanic, Proto-Athabaskan for Na-Dene, and regionally diffused systems in Australian and Bantu languages. Rather than being incompatible, naming taboos and definiteness marking appear to develop independently, with their intersection reflecting the typological diversity of human language.
