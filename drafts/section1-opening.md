# Section 1: Opening

## The Scene

In *The Parent Trap* (1998), the emotional center of the reunion isn't a revelation of biology; it's a restoration of a word. After eleven years engineered around separation—one parent per child, one child per parent—the father finds himself face-to-face with the daughter who has grown up without him. The scene is shot like a family reckoning, but the dialogue turns on something more miniature and more brutal: what you are allowed to *call* someone.

Nick reaches for the point that matters and, for once, says it plainly: "So let me see if I get this... you missed being able to call me Dad?" Annie answers just as plainly: "Yeah. I really have, Dad."

Nothing in that exchange is about reference; both speakers know exactly who is being talked to. The ache is about a social relation that English encodes—and polices—through address, where *Dad* is not descriptive content but a licensed stance of affiliation, entitlement, and obligation.

That licensing is so tight in English family life that its negation is instantly legible. A child who replaces *Dad* with *Nick* (or *Mom* with *Sarah*) is not merely "using a different label"; they are staging distance. And when the kinship term returns, it doesn't just report reconciliation—it performs it. 

The paper that follows treats that everyday naming taboo as a grammatical force: one reason English *Mom* and *Dad* behave, in key syntactic positions, less like common nouns and more like proper names.

## The Puzzle: Two Facts That Should Be Connected

Two facts about English kinship terms have been documented extensively. Neither literature cites the other. No one has proposed that they are causally linked.

**Fact 1 (Sociolinguistic):** English-speaking children virtually never address parents by first name. This is a social prohibition encoding power and solidarity (Brown & Gilman 1960, Dickey 1997). The asymmetry is stark: parents use children's first names freely; children use kinship terms. Violating the taboo—calling your mother *Sarah* at the dinner table—is face-threatening, marked, and culturally dispreferred across social classes.

**Fact 2 (Syntactic):** English kinship terms permit bare singular use where other count nouns do not.

> *Mom is here.* (grammatical)  
> \**Teacher is here.* (marginal/ungrammatical without context)  
> \**Neighbor is here.* (ungrammatical)

When used this way, *Mom* functions as a **strong proper name** (Huddleston & Pullum 2002): a noun phrase that appears without a determiner and refers to a unique individual. With a determiner—*my mom*, *the mom in question*—it functions as a common noun with relational meaning. The bare singular pattern is remarkable because English otherwise categorically rejects bare singular count nouns in argument position (\**I bought table*).

**The gap:** Nobody has connected these facts. The sociolinguistics literature documents the address asymmetry through power/solidarity frameworks. The syntax literature documents the determiner alternation and bare singular behavior. Neither cites the other; neither proposes a causal mechanism.

This paper fills that gap. The argument is simple: the social prohibition on first-name use forces high-frequency use of kinship terms in vocative and address position. That frequency—sustained across childhood and into adulthood—produces exactly the conditions under which grammaticalization toward proper-noun-like syntax occurs.

## The Proposed Mechanism

The causal pathway has four steps:

1. **Social prohibition:** Children can't use parents' first names. The taboo is enforced by correction, by awkwardness, by the visceral wrongness of hearing a peer say "Hey, Sarah" to their mother.

2. **Address function:** The prohibition forces kinship terms into the slot normally occupied by names. *Mom* and *Dad* become the primary vocative forms—the words a child uses to get a parent's attention, to address them directly, to refer to them in third-person conversation with other family members.

3. **High frequency:** This isn't occasional use. Children say *Mom* and *Dad* hundreds of thousands of times over the course of childhood. Each use is in a slot prototypically occupied by proper names.

4. **Grammaticalization:** Repetition in a name-like slot produces entrenchment. The form gets stored as an unanalyzed chunk with the distributional privileges of a proper name: it appears without a determiner, it refers to a unique individual, it resists modification in ways that common nouns don't.

Grammar, on this view, is "sedimented behavior" (Bybee 2010), not a set of abstract rules that "allow" exceptions. *Mom* isn't a common noun that the grammar happens to permit in a bare-singular slot. It's a form that has acquired proper-name syntax through the pressure of its use.

## What the CGEL Framework Provides

The analytical apparatus for this argument comes from *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* (Huddleston & Pullum 2002), which maintains strict category–function distinctions that earlier treatments conflate.

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Proper noun | Lexical category (single word) | *John*, *Mom* |
| Proper name | NP functioning as name (may be multi-word) | *the United Kingdom* |
| Strong proper name | Used without article | *Paris*, *Mom* |
| Weak proper name | Requires *the* | *the Thames*, *the Johnsons* |
| Bare singular | Count noun without determiner | Normally ungrammatical (\**table is here*) |

The key observation is that kinship terms show a functional split:

- **As strong proper names:** *Mom called.* (bare singular, unique reference, no determiner)
- **As common nouns:** *My mom called.* (determiner present, relational meaning)

CGEL itself notes this split in its treatment of vocatives (§5.20.5): kin terms are listed alongside personal names as NPs that can serve vocative function, and the text explicitly observes that "the kin terms include those that **can be used with the status of proper names**" (Huddleston & Pullum 2002: 522). *Mum*, *Mom*, and *Mummy* are given as examples. Other kin terms—*son*, *cousin*—are "hardly possible as proper names," showing that the category is graded rather than uniform.

This isn't polysemy in the usual sense. It's positional: the same lexical item acquires different syntactic privileges depending on whether it's functioning as a name or as a descriptive noun. The grammaticalization story explains *why* kinship terms developed this split: the taboo forces them into name position so frequently that they've acquired the distributional properties of names.

## Relation to Deitality and Definiteness

In a companion analysis (Reynolds 2025a), I distinguish **deitality**—a morphosyntactic property cluster—from **definiteness**—a semantic one. Deital determiners (*the*, *this*, *my*) show distributional restrictions: they resist existential pivots, license partitive complements, host identificational constructions. Definiteness is interpretive: identifiability, uniqueness, anaphoric recoverability.

Proper names occupy a distinctive position in this framework: they are **semantically definite** (they refer to unique, identifiable individuals) but **morphosyntactically non-deital** (they appear without determiners and don't show the distributional restrictions of deital NPs). English kinship terms, when functioning as names, pattern exactly this way. They're definite in meaning but bare in form—grammaticalized fossils of the taboo that shaped their use.

This explains why *Mom called* behaves more like *Paris welcomed visitors* than like *The mother called*. Both *Mom* and *Paris* are strong proper names: definite in interpretation, non-deital in morphosyntax. The kinship term has been pulled toward proper-name status by the social pressure of address.

## What Follows

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

Section 2 reviews the sociolinguistic literature on address forms and the naming taboo, establishing that the prohibition is robust, culturally enforced, and asymmetric.

Section 3 reviews the syntactic literature on proper nouns, bare nominals, and the CGEL apparatus, showing that kinship terms have the distributional profile of strong proper names.

Section 4 presents the core argument: the grammaticalization pathway from taboo to syntax, drawing on frequency-based accounts (Bybee), grammaticalization theory (Traugott), and the homeostatic property cluster framework.

Section 5 addresses the cross-linguistic dimension: English's naming taboo is "weak" compared to Chinese or Vietnamese systems, predicting that languages with stronger taboos should show even more robust proper-name syntax for kinship terms.

Section 6 considers objections and alternative explanations.

Section 7 concludes.

## Notes for Revision

- [ ] Verify *Parent Trap* dialogue against script
- [ ] Add corpus data on *Mom/Dad* frequency from COCA
- [ ] Consider whether to include *Family Guy* or *Shameless* examples as supplementary felt moments
- [ ] Tighten prose: target ~60 words per paragraph
